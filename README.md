# Issue with Vite HMR

This is a working example, where the package in `packages/another-package` is not bundled. Instead, Vite consumes directly its source code.

## Instructions

```shell
# run "npm install -g pnpm" if you do not have pnpm on your system
pnpm install
pnpm -r run dev
```

Then use the URL shown in the output to access the example app.
